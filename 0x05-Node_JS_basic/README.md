# NodeJS Basics

The learning objectives of this project are:

- run javascript using NodeJS
- use NodeJS modules
- use specific Node JS module to read files
- use `process` to access command line arguments and the environment
- create a small HTTP server using Node JS
- create a small HTTP server using Express JS
- create advanced routes with Express JS
- use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
- use Nodemon to develop faster

## 0. Executing basic javascript with Node JS
In the file `0-console.js`, create a function named `displayMessage` that prints in STDOUT the string argument.

## 1. Using Process stdin
Create a program named 1-stdin.js that will be executed through command line:

- It should display the message `Welcome to Holberton School, what is your name?` (followed by a new line)
- The user should be able to input their name on a new line
- The program should display `Your name is: INPUT`
When the user ends the program, it should display - `This important software is now closing` (followed by a new line)

**Requirements:**
- Your code will be tested through a child process, make sure you have everything you need for that

## 2. Reading a file synchronously with Node JS
Using the database `database.csv` (provided in project description), create a function `countStudents` in the file `2-read_file.js`

- Create a function named `countStudents`. It should accept a path in argument
- The script should attempt to read the database file synchronously
- If the database is not available, it should throw an error with the text `Cannot load the database`
- If the database is available, it should log the following message to the console `Number of students: NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS`
- It should log the number of students in each field, and the list with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
- CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!

## 3. Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS
Using the database `database.csv` (provided in project description), create a function `countStudents` in the file `3-read_file_async.js`

- Create a function named `countStudents`. It should accept a path in argument (same as in `2-read_file.js`)
- The script should attempt to read the database file asynchronously
- The function should return a Promise
- If the database is not available, it should throw an error with the text `Cannot load the database`
- If the database is available, it should log the following message to the console `Number of students: NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS`
- It should log the number of students in each field, and the list with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
- CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!

## 4. Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module
In a file named `4-http.js`, create a small HTTP server using the `http` module:

- It should be assigned to the variable `app` and this one must be exported
- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- Displays `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body for any endpoint as plain text

## 5. Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module
In a file named `5-http.js`, create a small HTTP server using the `http` module:

- It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- It should return plain text
- When the URL path is `/`, it should display `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body
- When the URL path is `/students`, it should display `This is the list of our students` followed by the same content as the file `3-read_file_async.js` (with and without the database) - the name of the database must be passed as argument of the file
- CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!

## 6. Create a small HTTP server using Express
Install Express and in a file named `6-http_express.js`, create a small HTTP server using Express module:

- It should be assigned to the variable `app` and this one must be exported
- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- Displays `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body for the endpoint `/`

## 7. Create a more complex HTTP server using Express
In a file named `7-http_express.js`, recreate the small HTTP server using `Express`:

- It should be assigned to the variable app and this one must be exported
- HTTP server should listen on port 1245
- It should return plain text
- When the URL path is /, it should display `Hello Holberton School!` in the page body
- When the URL path is `/students`, it should display `This is the list of our students` followed by the same content as the file `3-read_file_async.js` (with and without the database) - the name of the database must be passed as argument of the file
- CSV file can contain empty lines (at the end) - and they are not a valid student!

## 8. Organize a complex HTTP server using Express
Obviously writing every part of a server within a single file is not sustainable. Let’s create a full server in a directory named `full_server`.

Since you have used ES6 and Babel in the past projects, let’s use `babel-node` to allow to use ES6 functions like `import` or `export`.

### 8.1 Organize the structure of the server
- Create 2 directories within:
    - `controllers`
    - `routes`
- Create a file `full_server/utils.js`, in the file create a function named `readDatabase` that accepts a file path as argument:
    - It should read the database asynchronously
    - It should return a promise
    - When the file is not accessible, it should reject the promise with the error
    - When the file can be read, it should return an object of arrays of the firstname of students per fields
### 8.2 Write the App controller
Inside the file `full_server/controllers/AppController.js`:

- Create a class named `AppController`. Add a static method named `getHomepage`
- The method accepts `request` and `response` as argument. It returns a 200 status and the message `Hello Holberton School!`

### 8.3 Write the Students controller
Inside the file `full_server/controllers/StudentsController.js`, create a class named StudentsController. Add two static methods:

The first one is `getAllStudents`:

- The method accepts `request` and `response` as argument
- It should return a status 200
- It calls the function `readDatabase` from the `utils` file, and display in the page:
    - First line: `This is the list of our students`
    - And for each field (order by alphabetic order case insensitive), a line that displays the number of students in the field, and the list of first names (ordered by appearance in the database file) with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
- If the database is not available, it should return a status 500 and the error message `Cannot load the database`

The second one is `getAllStudentsByMajor`:

- The method accepts `request` and `response` as argument
- It should return a status 200
- It uses a parameter that the user can pass to the browser `major`. The major can only be `CS` or `SWE`. If the user is passing another parameter, the server should return a 500 and the error `Major parameter must be CS or SWE`
- It calls the function `readDatabase` from the utils file, and display in the page the list of first names for the students (ordered by appearance in the database file) in the specified field `List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES_IN_THE_FIELD`
If the database is not available, it should return a status 500 and the error message `Cannot load the database`

### 8.4 Write the routes
Inside the file `full_server/routes/index.js`:

- Link the route `/` to the `AppController`
- Link the route `/students` and `/students/:majorto the StudentsController`

### 8.5 Write the server reusing everything you created
Inside the file named `full_server/server.js`, create a small Express server:

- It should use the routes defined in `full_server/routes/index.js`
- It should use the port `1245`

### 8.6 Update `package.json` (if you are running it from outside the folder `full_server`)
If you are starting node from outside of the folder `full_server`, you will have to update the command `dev` by: `nodemon --exec babel-node --presets babel-preset-env ./full_server/server.js ./database.csv`

**Warning:**
- Don’t forget to export your express app at the end of `server.js` (`export default app;`)
- The database filename is passed as argument of the `server.js` BUT, for testing purpose, you should retrieve this filename at the execution (when `getAllStudents` or `getAllStudentsByMajor` are called for example)

If you want to add test to validate your integration, you will need to add this file: `.babelrc`
```
{
    "presets": [["env", {"exclude": ["transform-regenerator"]}]]
}
